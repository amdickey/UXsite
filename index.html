<p style="font-weight: lighter">I could not agree more with that statement. I mean who doesn't feel like they just need music in their life? And to be in front of<span style="font-style: italic"> live music?</span> A concert can truly be a healing moment and if people want to go in a last minute scenario there needs to be an easy way to help find their cure. This is exactly what drew me in to this project with Hi Karl. I want to tell you all about this story and take you through my four month journey in a seven part case study to show you the entire process from the very beginning phases all the way to the final experience.</p>
<h3>Project Overview:</h3>
<p><strong>Hi Karl</strong> is a NYC-based startup company specializing in live music and event discovery in the entertainment industry. Its founders, Florian Doumenc (CEO) and Rhy Walsh-Tindall (Engineer), always found it hard to find really great concerts, and especially in a last minute scenario. In addition to their problem, they discovered that in today’s industry about 30% of all event tickets are never sold, resulting in an estimated $15B loss for revenues, artists, and promoters. Hi Karl was created to bridge this gap between its users and customers by offering promoters a platform to push and promote their events to the users who are seeking to go out and find last minute concerts. The ultimate goal of Hi Karl is to become the number one last minute live music and event discovery service. Karl is an AI-powered personal assistant that aggregates all events in an area, and by utilizing its target users listening habits and streaming data/analytics, Karl offers ease and efficiency in last minute event discovery.

<p style="font-weight: lighter; padding-bottom: 150px;">In the diverse world of concert discovery services, I wanted to be able to identify the right problem to solve and help my client determine and understand what it is they want to accomplish. In order to help better define my vison for this case study, I needed to define my specific role. Early in the discovery phase I set out to construct the Hi Karl problem statement and after thorough research and analysis displayed in this case study, I came up with the following:
</p>


<img src="images/Wireframeset.png" class="wireframes"/>

<h3>Problem Statement:</h3>
<p>To create an attractive, enjoyable, and intuitive design solution with user-engaging features that will help millenial concertgoers discover new and appealing last-minute concerts, while also serving as an effective opportunity for venue owners to showcase their events in order to sell any and all remaining tickets.
</p>




<h3>My Role:</h3>
<p>My role in this project was to improve the user experience of Hi Karl and to also redesign and rebrand Hi Karl. Based on my research from the case study I have chosen not to focus on the Facebook Messenger chat bot service, Alexa service, or the current web platform, but instead focus on designing Hi Karl as a free stand alone mobile app. I focused on the visual design, user experience, and functionality of this new platform from the beginning login screen through the search and results processes. I did not examine the ticket purchase aspect but solely on the UI/UX of the process of users finding a last minute concert using the new mobile application. I am responsible for all user and market research, the redesign and rebrand, UI/UX strategy, the visual design through numerous wire framing and prototyping, and the intuitive solution of a new platform for Hi Karl.

<div class="competition">
<p style="font-weight: lighter">If I was going to make great and informative design decisions for the new Hi Karl mobile app, I needed to take a closer look at the direct competition and study event discovery objectives. I wanted to find opportunities by studying the latest design trends, examining features, and looking for strength and weakness comparisons. I decided to make a list of the Hi Karl competition and narrow it down to three main competitors for analysis: <br>
  <strong>Bandsintown, Songkick, and Thrillcall</strong>.

<p style="font-weight: lighter">I divided Hi Karl’s target audience into three groups: the <strong>users</strong> (millennial concertgoers), the <strong>customers</strong> (venue owners and event promoters), and the <strong>influencers</strong> (artists and sponsor/endorsement/investor relations). I decided to focus my research on Hi Karl’s users, the millennial concertgoers. To help address my research needs for Hi Karl, I wanted to use a qualitative and observational research plan approach with the AEIOU framework (Activities, Environments, Interactions, Objects, and Users).
