     <h1>THE HI KARL STORY</h1>
     <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
     <br>
     <br>
     <p>Hi Karl is a NYC-based startup company specializing in live music and event discovery in the music and entertainment industry. Its founders always found it hard to find really great concerts, and especially in a last minute scenario. In addition to their problem, they discovered that in todayâ€™s industry about 30% of all event tickets are never sold, resulting in an estimated $15B loss for revenues, artists, and promoters. Hi Karl was created to bridge this gap between users and promoters by offering promoters a platform to push and promote their events to the users who are seeking to go out and find last minute concerts. Their ultimate goal is to become the number one last minute live music and event discovery service. Karl is an AI-powered personal assistant that aggregates all events in an area, and by utilizing target users listening habits and streaming data/analytics, Karl offers ease and efficiency in last minute event discovery for concertgoers.

<p style="text-align:center">To create an attractive and enjoyable intuitive design solution with user-engaging features that will help concertgoers discover new, appealing last-minute concerts and also serving as an effective opportunity for venue owners to showcase their events in order to sell any and all remaining tickets.
