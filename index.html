    <h3>"Music cures..."</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center"><em>- User Response</em></p>
    <br>
    <p>I could not agree more with this statement from my research. I mean who doesn't feel need for music in their life? And to be in front of<span style="font-style: italic"> live music</span>? A concert can truly be a healing moment and if people need one in a last minute scenario there needs to be an easy way to help find their cure. A few months ago I found myself in need of some music healing and I wanted to find a concert right away. This is exactly what drew me in to this project with Hi Karl. I want to tell you all about this story and take you through my four month journey in a seven part case study to show you the entire process from the very beginning phases all the way to the final experience.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Project Overview:</h3>
    <p><strong>Hi Karl</strong> is a NYC-based startup company specializing in live music and event discovery in the entertainment industry. Its founders, Florian Doumenc (CEO) and Rhy Walsh-Tindall (Engineer), always found it hard to find really great concerts, and especially in a last minute scenario. In addition to their problem, they discovered that in today’s industry about 30% of all event tickets are never sold, resulting in an estimated $15B loss for revenues, artists, and promoters. Hi Karl was created to bridge this gap between its users and customers by offering promoters a platform to push and promote their events to the users who are seeking to go out and find last minute concerts. The ultimate goal of Hi Karl is to become the number one last minute live music and event discovery service. Karl is an AI-powered personal assistant that aggregates all events in an area, and by utilizing its target users listening habits and streaming data/analytics, Karl offers ease and efficiency in last minute event discovery.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Current Platforms:</h3>
    <p style="text-align: center">Hi Karl is available live across three current platforms:
    <br><a href="m.me/HiKarl.official" style="color: #04e8ff">Facebook Messenger Chatbot</a> |
    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B06Y1T5J1T" style="color: #04e8ff">Alexa</a> |

      <h2>IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM</h2>
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>

<img src="images/Wireframeset.png" class="wireframes"/>
  <section class="section">

    <p>In the diverse world of concert discovery services, I wanted to be able to identify the right problem to solve and help my client determine and understand what it is they want to accomplish. In order to help better define my vison for this case study, I needed to define my specific role. Early in the discovery phase I set out to construct the Hi Karl problem statement and after thorough research and analysis displayed in this case study, I came up with the following:
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Problem Statement:</h3>
    <p>To create an attractive, enjoyable, and intuitive design solution with user-engaging features that helps millenial concertgoers discover new and appealing last-minute concerts, while also serving as an effective opportunity for venue owners to promote their events in order to sell unsold tickets.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>My Role:</h3>
    <p>My role in this project was to improve the user experience of Hi Karl and to also redesign and rebrand Hi Karl. Based on my research from the case study I have chosen not to focus on the Facebook Messenger chat bot service, Alexa service, or the current web platform, but instead focus on designing Hi Karl as a free stand alone mobile app. I focused on the visual design, user experience, and functionality of this new platform from the beginning login screen through the search and results processes. I did not examine the ticket purchase aspect but solely on the UI/UX of the process of users finding a last minute concert using the new mobile application. I am responsible for all user and market research, the redesign and rebrand, UI/UX strategy, the visual design through numerous wireframing and prototyping, and the delivery of a new intuitive solution platform for Hi Karl.

      <h2>STUDYING OBJECTIVES</h2>
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <section class="section">
    <p>If I was going to make good, informative design decisions for the new Hi Karl mobile app, I needed to take a closer look at the direct competition and study event discovery objectives. I wanted to find opportunities by studying the latest design trends, examining features, and looking for strength and weakness comparisons. I decided to make a list of the Hi Karl competition and narrow it down to three main app competitors for analysis:
    <p style="text-align:center"><strong>Bandsintown, Songkick, and Thrillcall</strong></p>
    </p>

      <h2>UNDERSTANDING THE TARGET</h2>
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <section class="section">
    <p>I divided Hi Karl’s target audience into three groups: the <strong>users</strong> (millennial concertgoers), the <strong>customers</strong> (venue owners and event promoters), and the <strong>influencers</strong> (artists and sponsor/endorsement/investor relations). Because my role was to create a new mobile app, I focused my research entirely on the Hi Karl users. To better understand the users of Hi Karl and develop a proper design strategy, I wanted to be able to discover and share some insights and behaviors. With my research, I created two millenial personas from both ends of the spectrum, one being a frequent weekly concertgoer, and the other attending 1 or 2 concerts per month. For each persona below, I document their bio profile, current concert discovery solutions, goals, frustrations, and motivations.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Personas:</h3>
  </section>
    <img src="images/Tom.jpg" class="personas"/>
  <section class="section">
    <h4><strong>Concert Discovery Solutions:</strong></h4>
    <p>Tom uses various social networks, mobile apps, websites and word of mouth when trying to find a concert. Some examples that he uses are Facebook, Bandsintown app (his current personal recommendation but admits it is not perfect), Thrillcall App, Pollstar, and information from friends.</p>
    <h4><strong>Goals:</strong></h4>
    <p>Tom would like to spend less time on fewer apps and discovery options to find the latest and greatest concerts. He wants to continue to see as many shows as possible and to share his concert events with this social followers and friends.</p>
    <h4><strong>Frustrations:</strong></h4>
    <p>One of Tom's biggest frustrations when trying to find a concert is that he can’t seem to find any app or website site that lists all shows consistently. He notices that some are missing from others, sometimes the events get cancelled altogether, and some venues even forget to create promotion events for their feature concerts.</p>
    <h4><strong>Motivations:</strong></h4>
    <p>Tom's motivations in a concert search include price, availability, convenience, event giveaways/rewards, effecient event calendars, and social event awareness.</p>
  </section>
    <img src="images/Beth.jpg" class="personas"/>
  <section class="section">
    <h4><strong>Concert Discovery Solutions:</strong></h4>
    <p>Beth uses social networks, word of mouth, mobile apps, and also local venue and city event websites when trying to find a concert. Some examples that she uses are Facebook, Google search, Nashville Guru, Do615, and talking/texting with her friends.</p>
    <h4><strong>Goals:</strong></h4>
    <p>If her new monthly work schedule allows, Beth would love to go to 1 to 2 concerts each month. She wants to find a new app to find concerts that will allow her to easily listen to artists, discover new artists, and share a good concert event that she likes with her friends.</p>
    <h4><strong>Frustrations:</strong></h4>
    <p>Beth's frustrations include not knowing her work schedule changes and wishes there was a way she could have a better calendar for work and concerts.</p>
    <h4><strong>Motivations:</strong></h4>
    <p>Beth's motivations in a concert search include price, availability, convenience, efficiency, new events, and event sharing.</p>

      <h2>ESSENCE OF THE DATA</h2>
      </span>
    </div>
  </div>

  <section class="section">
    <p>Now that I had established my personas, it was time to form my <strong>research plan</strong>, develop an <strong>interview guide</strong>, and create a user <strong>journey map</strong>. To help address my research needs for Hi Karl, I wanted to use a qualitative and observational research plan approach with an AEIOU framework and begin listing the activities, environments, interactions, objects, and users.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>AEIOU Research Plan:</h3>
    <h4><strong>Activities:</strong></h4>
    <p>User searching for concerts, reading, listening to music, inviting/sharing with friends via web, mobile apps, or in-person conversation, and traveling.
    <h4><strong>Environments:</strong></h4>
    <p>Homes of millenials, in the car/taxi service, work setting, school, social gatherings and hangouts, music venues, online, and social media.</p>
    <h4><strong>Interactions:</strong></h4>
    <p>Exchange experience between millenial users and a computer or mobile device, conversation with friends, effective vs noneffective print material, and the user experience of various discovery websites and mobile apps.</p>
    <h4><strong>Objects:</strong></h4>
    <p>Computers, mobile devices, concert discovery apps, chatbot services, music blogs, venue websites, local event websites, print services, and artist websites.</p>
    <h4><strong>Users:</strong></h4>
    <p>Millenial concertgoers (in this case study, Tom and Beth).
    <h3>Interview Guide:</h3>
    <p>I needed a stong interview guide to discover as many valuable behavioral patterns, insights, themes, frustrations, surprises, and takeaways that I could apply to my project solution. I interviewed a total of 15 millenial concertgoers ranging from 18 - 35 years old. I wanted to setup a comparative interview guide administered in three different models. I conducted 2 (six question interviews) through facebook messenger meetings, 7 (thirteen question interviews) with Gmail, and 6 (eight question interviews) using Google Surveys. The questions used in my interview guide process covered user patterns regarding age, profession, discovery solutions currently used, the amount per month they realistically attend a concert, the likeliness of attending a concert while traveling, the frequency of facebook messenger use, the music streaming services they prefer, what they care most about in a concert discovery app, thoughts on the current Hi Karl UI and experience, their frustrations, the competition, and any user recommendations. I also asked the users their likeliness preference between using a discovery website, an app, or an AI chatbot in a last minute scenario. Below are some takeaways from my 15 millenial research interviews:
    </p>
    <h4><strong>Insights &amp; Surprises:</strong></h4>
    <p>With all the latest technology available to millenials, most do not find it frustrating at all to find concerts. When asked which method they would prefer to use in a last-minute situation between a concert discovery app, website, Chabot, or other (list), not one listed a chatbot service. I discovered that Facebook messenger was not as high a priority to them as I thought. I also found that the avid concertgoer uses not one, but multiple discovery apps and websites to stay up to date on all upcoming concerts.</p>
    <h4><strong>Themes:</strong></h4>
    I found many common themes and patterns throughout the interview process that I knew would impact my design strategy for the new Hi Karl mobie app. In a last-minute situation, most users preferred to use a mobile app and saw it as a much faster and efficient solution. The most important elements to the users of a discovery app, in no particular order, are visual design, ease of use, the ability to preview/listen to artists, sharing capabilities, and easy purchase options in the app. Out of the many music streaming services, the majority preferred to use Spotify. All users were fully aware of the major direct competitors to Hi Karl. I discovered that they all realistically would like to go to 1 to 2 concerts per month, and they are interested in being able to share their events with friends. Most users consider themselves to be organized. If they were to be traveling or on a vacation, a majority of the users stated that going to a concert would depend entirely on the artist.</p>
    <h4><strong>Frustrations:</strong></h4>
    <p>Some of the frustrations I came across from my interviews included ticket prices based on their personal feelings of incomes and budgets, ticket abvailability, apps not having all the correct and latest concert events, finding new artists that they like through discovery apps, lack of promotion, and issues with cancelled events.</p>

    <h3>Goals &amp; Constraints:</h3>
    <p>To help Hi Karl make their ultimate impact, I believe Hi Karl offered as a mobile application can create a more efficient way for users to find last minute concerts by reaching more users and also a way for Hi Karl to become more competitive in the live music event discovery industry.
